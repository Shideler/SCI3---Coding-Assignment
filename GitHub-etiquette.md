A few GitHub rules:

1). Keep file paths short and sensible.

2). Don’t use funky (%$*&^%) characters and spaces in your file names, 
these cause trouble because of differences in Mac/Windows systems.

3). Always, always, pull before you start working on your project and before you push.
There's nothing more frustrating that a case where someone has done some work since 
the last time you pulled. You wouldn’t want anyone’s work to get lost or to 
have to resolve multiple coding conflicts.
